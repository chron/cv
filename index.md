## Personal Statement

I am an experienced and enthusiastic full-stack developer who has been working with the Ruby on Rails framework for many years. I’m friendly, a quick learner, and I have fantastic communication skills. I’ve been cultivating my technical leadership skills and I’m excited about growing my career past being a capable individual contributor.

I consider myself a very strong Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer, and that’s where my passion lies.

## Skills

### Diverse Development Skillset

I’ve worked with a variety of different technologies and that has strengthened my skills as a developer. My current job is centered around Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, and the Amazon AWS stack. I’ve worked extensively with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/CoffeScript. In the past I have used PHP, VB.NET, and Java. I’ve also had some experience with Coldfusion, TSQL, C#, and Centura in my work at Pumpkin Patch. I’m familiar with several modern javascript frameworks, mainly React and Ember. When the situation required it, I’ve been able to pick up a new language (for example Delphi) quickly to be able to make changes to an existing codebase.

### Innovative and Creative

I’m great at problem solving and thinking outside the box. I can identify the right tool to use for each job, and I design solutions that meet users’ needs rather than just fulfilling a brief. I’ve worked with designers and UX specialists and I can contribute to the creative process rather than just following instructions.

### Diligent and Motivated

I love learning and I’m always excited to work with new tech. I’m very self-motivated and autonomous. I’m versatile and happy to take on unusual tasks; for example in a previous role I spent a month in Australia travelling round and managing a major software rollout to our retail stores there, including training the in-store staff.

### Team Leader and Mentor

I’ve worked as a team leader and technical lead, and I’ve trained numerous junior devs new to Rails or to development in general. My work at Flick includes a people leadership component so I’m very comfortable with helping other team members reach their potential. I’m comfortable teaching and I’m very approachable for questions. I’m great at context switching so I have no problems bouncing between helping people and project work without losing momentum.

### Strong Interpersonal and Communication Skills

I have excellent written and oral communication skills, and I work well in a team environment. I’m quite happy to interact directly with business users and explain technical concepts in plain language. I’m familiar with all aspects of the typical IT lifecycle, and interacting within an IT team including Business Analysts, Project Managers, Designers, and dedicated QA staff.
My documentation is clear and comprehensive and I’m good at making realistic estimates for development work.

### Strong Computer Science Fundamentals

My Computer Science degree built a solid base for working with computers - I have a good understanding of how things really work under the hood, not just surface-level development concerns. I know about the theories behind things like Big O Notation or IEEE754 Floating Point Arithmetic and that informs the development I do today. I’m familiar with object-oriented and functional programming paradigms and incorporating elements of both into my work. I’m very comfortable with a wide variety of platforms, including OSX, Windows, and Linux. I can assemble a computer from parts.

### Tech/Tools I Work With Regularly

* **Rails 4/5/6** - ​My current job is “full stack” rails development - along with a team of 15 or so
developers I help steward a large Rails monolith. I’m in my element writing, maintaining, and
debugging large Rails projects.
* **Ruby** - ​I was a Ruby developer before I was a Rails developer and I’m really happy writing clear,
clever, idiomatic ruby. I’ve been involved in several Ruby projects that were not Rails applications.
* **Mysql**, Postgres & TSQL ​- I’ve worked on many database-oriented applications and services so much of my time has been spent working in SQL. I am very comfortable writing performant and elegant
queries, as well as architecting sensible data models. I understand relational and set theory.
* **NoSQL** - I’ve worked a fair bit with DynamoDB and FaunaDB, and with the general paradigm of
document databases.
* **AWS** - ​I work a lot with many different parts of AWS. I’m comfortable with both CloudFormation and
Terraform for infrastructure-as-code.
* **HTML** ​- I’m comfortable writing HTML by hand and using templating languages like HAML, ERB,
Jade/pug, Liquid, and JSX. and I have an excellent understanding of HTTP and the general web stack,
including technologies like AJAX and websockets.
* **CSS / SASS** ​- I have a lot of experience writing CSS by hand and getting pages to display correctly
across multiple browsers. I write SASS/SCSS every day at my current job and I have experience
following BEM, SMACSS and ITCSS guidelines.
* **JavaScript** ​- I use JavaScript frequently day-to-day. I’ve built a fairly large Ember application and
several React applications from scratch.
* **Serverless** ​- I'm very familiar with AWS lambda, and I’ve used frameworks like Serverless and Architect a
little. I’ve deployed several personal projects using Netlify functions.
* **Version Control** ​- I’m intimately familiar with Git and Github. I’ve used Team Foundation Server and
VSS heavily, and have some experience with SVN. I have collaborated numerous times on projects
with other developers, including writing (and receiving!) thoughtful and empathetic code reviews.
* **Docker** ​- I’ve used docker extensively as a development tool and to run our staging environments at
Hashbang. At Flick we use docker on ECS for our production deployments. I’m familiar with Vagrant and general virtualization principles.
